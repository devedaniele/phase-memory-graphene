# Phase-Memory Response in Strained Graphene (Phenomenological Note)

This repository contains a short, testable phenomenological proposal concerning a possible emergent state in strained graphene.  
The intent is to highlight a specific experimental possibility that may be worth verification or falsification.

---

## Summary

It is proposed that under **non-uniform strain gradients** and **weak oscillatory electromagnetic perturbations**, graphene may support a **metastable phase-memory response** characterized by:

- History-dependent phase-sensitive behavior  
- Persistence after removal of external driving  
- Absence of sustained charge current  
- Absence of magnetic hysteresis  
- No measurable energy dissipation  

If observed, such a response would be distinct from superconducting, topological, valley, or charge-density-wave phenomena currently cataloged in graphene systems.

The proposal is framed entirely in terms of experimentally observable behavior, independent of any specific microscopic interpretation.

## Operational Description (What to Look For)

The proposed effect is defined operationally rather than theoretically:

1. Apply a weak oscillatory electromagnetic perturbation to strained graphene  
2. Remove the perturbation  
3. Measure phase-sensitive observables  
4. Check whether the response depends on prior system history  

Crucially, conventional observables such as resistance, magnetization, and temperature should return to baseline values.

## Expected Experimental Signatures

- Phase-sensitive response persisting after perturbation removal  
- No long-lived charge trapping or resistance hysteresis  
- No magnetic or thermal memory  
- Directional dependence correlated with strain geometry  
- Slow, reversible relaxation without dissipation  

---

## Experimental Accessibility

The proposed signatures should be accessible using existing graphene platforms, including:

- Monolayer or bilayer graphene  
- Controlled strain gradients  
- Phase-sensitive transport or spectroscopy  
- Scanning probe or time-resolved techniques  

Appropriate controls should rule out defect-based charge trapping, spin accumulation, heating, or known topological mechanisms.

---

## Falsification Criteria

The proposal is falsified if all observed memory-like effects can be fully explained by established mechanisms such as:

- Charge trapping  
- Magnetic ordering  
- Thermal relaxation  
- Known topological or valley effects

## Scope and Intent

This note is intentionally limited in scope.  
It does not claim novelty of underlying mechanisms, nor does it attempt to provide a microscopic theory.  
Its sole purpose is to suggest a **specific, experimentally testable question**.

## Status

Open for independent verification, falsification, or reinterpretation using existing experimental platforms.
